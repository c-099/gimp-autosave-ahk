# gimp-autosave-ahk

This script automatically saves your current image by virtually pressing ctrl+s when you release the left mouse button.

Does not try to save when clicking tools or menu items. Adjust this to the size of your gimp window layout. For me its: x <= 275 or y <= 170

Does not try to save more than one time every 5 seconds.

Does not try to save when GIMP window title includes "*[Untitled]"
